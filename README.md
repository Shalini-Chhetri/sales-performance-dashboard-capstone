# Capstone Project: Sales Performance Dashboard

**Business Analytics | Tableau | Looker Studio | Data Visualization**

This capstone project features two interactive business dashboards—one built in Tableau and the other in Looker Studio—designed to analyze sales and profitability across product categories, customer segments, and U.S. regions. Using the popular Superstore dataset, the dashboards provide actionable insights for data-driven decision-making.
